This is a code example for how you can use Danswer's APIs to build a chat bot widget for a website! The main code to look at can be found in `src/app/widget/Widget.tsx`.

If you want to get fancier, then take a peek at the Chat implementation within Danswer itself [here](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/web/src/app/chat/ChatPage.tsx#L82).

## Getting Started

First, install the requirements:

```bash
npm i
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
